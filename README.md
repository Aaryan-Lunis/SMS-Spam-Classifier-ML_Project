# 📩 SMS Spam Classifier

A Machine Learning-powered web app that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** in real-time using NLP and a trained model. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

**🔗 [sms-spam-classifier.streamlit.app](https://sms-spam-classifier-mlproject-cwrwdzkrmqpdy3ybxf5cib.streamlit.app/)**

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Classifies any input SMS as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- 🧠 Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing
- 📊 Displays prediction confidence score
- 📚 Jupyter Notebook included to explain training and evaluation
- 🗃️ Maintains a local prediction history (with option to delete)
- ⚡ Clean, modern UI with real-time behavior
- 🌐 Fully deployed and accessible online

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing stopwords
   - Stemming using NLTK

2. **Vectorization:**
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`)

3. **Model:**
   - Trained using Naive Bayes / any scikit-learn classifier
   - Pickled as `model.pkl`

4. **Notebook:**
   - Full training pipeline and evaluation included in `spam_classifier_training.ipynb`

5. **UI:**
   - Built using Streamlit with custom CSS for a clean look
   - Automatically hides result when input is cleared
   - Tracks last 5 predictions locally

## 📦 Installation (For Local Run)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sms-spam-classifier.git
cd sms-spam-classifier
````

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. (Optional) Run the notebook:

You can open `spam_classifier_training.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code** to explore how the model was trained.
